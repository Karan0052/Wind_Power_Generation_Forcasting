## Wind_Power_Generation_Forcasting 

This project focuses on forecasting wind power output using real-world datasets and machine learning models. Built during my internship, the goal is to enable data-driven decision-making in **renewable energy management** — especially supporting farmers and energy providers through better predictions.

## Project Objectives

- Forecast wind power generation from environmental factors.
- Help farmers plan irrigation schedules by predicting power availability.
- Reduce reliance on diesel generators during power outages.
- Build a model that can be scaled to real-world deployment.

##  Why This Matters (Green Skills in Action)

- Encourages clean energy forecasting using AI/ML.
- Reduces carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency.
- Empowers the agricultural sector with **climate-resilient technology**.
- Supports **green economy** goals and sustainable infrastructure.
